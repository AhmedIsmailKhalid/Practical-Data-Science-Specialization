__label__1 "finally saw this dress online . i have to say that it looks better in person . the model might be too tall for this dress . i am 5 ' 4 '' . it 's right to my ankle . the color is in a nice off white . the material is a good quality . the overall cut is nice . it 's a kind of classic feeling.you could wear it for a long time without going out of style ."
__label__1 "this . an unexpected purchase ... i found this on my way to the dressing room . the fit is stunning . i sized way down ( i.e . normally wear 10/12 curvy and bought a small ) . it accentuates my curves and is incredibly flattering . i bought the navy and will be adding another color soon ! the material is viscose blend - soft and flowy . it 's a nice addition to my work wardrobe ."
__label__1 "i originally ordered the peach stripe tee in my normal size medium . after going to the store and trying another color on in a small i realized i should have sized down . i have since purchased the blue stripe in the smaller size . i love the fit and the colorful stripes of both . great light-weight casual tee . i love the button details on the shoulder ."
__label__1 "i got some nice things for christmas but this ( along with the matching leggings ) was hands down my absolute favorite gift ! so stylish so cozy the perfect length to cover your bottom the perfect fit ( 38dd and ordered an xl ) love the pockets i could go on and on . the perfect set to lounge around the house in . sleeves are a bit long so i had to fold them . when i say it is the perfect fit it is oversized ( not huge ) but it is roomy and that 's how i like it as loungewear ."
__label__-1 "i am 5 7 135 lbs the small fit well in the bust but no shape . it was just big and frumpy . it went back ."
__label__0 "i saw this in that postcard catalog and it drew my attention immediately so when i saw it at the store i knew i would try it on . this dress is gorgeous - the lace is sturdy and wo n't easily be caught on things the chambray is substantial but light . it 's put together well and the slip covers greatly . the material is n't stretchy but it keeps it shape and i like that . i 'm 5 ' 7 and it hit me right at the knee so it 's a good length if you wanted to wear it with a cardigan to work as a spring"
__label__0 "i fell in love with this skirt when i saw it on display so i had the store order me an xspetite . it seemed like the perfect lightweight summer skirt that would go with everything . it arrived today and i was a bit underwhelmed with the way it actually fit on me . it is kind of a thick linen/cottony material and just did n't lay down well bunching out on the sides in a way i did n't find to be very flattering . so 5 stars for print and whimsy and charm but 3 stars for actual fit on . alas it is going"
__label__1 "love the design and colors runs a but large through the middle"
__label__-1 "loved this shirt when i saw the picture . unfortunately fit was not what it needed to be to keep it . you ca n't really see in the photo but if you have any chest at all ( i am only 34b ... so would say of average size bust ) this shirt will not fit well . there is a seam in the bust area that cuts across the bust which is not flattering/does n't fit well . the sleeves were also a bit more tight than i 'd have thought from the photo . really wanted to love this - but unless you have a smaller chest it lik"
__label__-1 "these have a very interesting cut . it seems like they were made for someone extremely tall . i 'm about 5 ' 5 and the size 4 fit in the waist but fell way below where they do on the model on the picture . it 's hard to imagine who they would look good on they 're also very poofy right below the waist ."
__label__1 "this is even cuter in person than it is in the picture . it was hanging on a rack by the dressing room so i tried it on on a whim and loved it ! so so soft too ! runs true to size . i am 5 ' 2 and 125 and got a small ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to like this ... it 's soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue but that 's where the positives end . i ordered the xs and it was huge . wide shapeless and way too long ( i 'm 105lbs and 5 ' 1 ) . even if it came in petite i 'm not sure it 's worth the price because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love the stress so much i mean who does n't love polkadots and a good maxi ! unfortunately the fit was too awkward . the bust is saggy and the waist seems to poof out"
__label__-1 "i 'm very disappointed in the quality . it seems more like a pajama than a tunic . definitely not worth 100.00 dollars . i plan to return it ."
__label__1 "this is the most flattering shirt -- love the fit and color !"
__label__0 "like the idea of this shirt so much . but the neckline was still way too low- the top of my bra was visible . wishing the under layer really covered as no way i 'm going to another layer to an already layered shirt . might just be my body type so might work for someone else but sending back ."
__label__1 "these are some of the few pants that are semi loose with a wide waist band that make me look thinner ! i love them . they are soft ! they match everything . they make an outfit effortlessly chic . i took a size m and it fit tts ."
__label__1 "first i found the picture of this blouse stunning because the colors caught my attention . with that said i found myself thinking of all the many events this could worn to dressed up or down . so .... i found myself ordering it asap paranoid that others were thinking i was thinking the same thing . well i received it in the mail and it was better than i thought ! ! ! the colors and cut of this blouse is just as in the picture . i personally love this article/pattern of art as i see it as an exp"
__label__-1 "i thought it was going to be so pretty . it is ugly on . the macrame is thick stiff and rough . the top fits awkward on top where the macrame is and the rest is shapeless . yuk !"
__label__0 "i tried this in my normal sp . i found it to run a little snug but the neckline was way too low for every-day wear ."
__label__-1 "i was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern . however the embroidery takes away any stretchy-ness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but ill-fitting harness for anyone with any breasts or full-figured lusciousness . the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top . i wanted to keep this but h"
__label__-1 "i saw this dress and loved everything about it ! i was so sad when i tried it on and it was just too big . they were out of the smaller size so i had to return it . the dress is well made and the color is just a bit neon compared to the picture ."
__label__0 "i 'm on the fence about this one . it is pretty"
__label__0 "i 'm 5 ' 6 and it hits me at mid-thigh . the top ( black/camel version ) is sheer enough to need a cami . the waist is quite high . not flattering for me -- the empire waist makes me look a bit pregnant -- plus i do n't want to deal with having to wear a cami ."
__label__1 "my favorite pants ! they do run slightly large so i sized down . i have 3 colors and will continue to add more !"
__label__-1 "i really liked this shirt the one time i got to wear it ... but when i washed it according to the directions on the tag it shrunk ! a lot ! the sleeves are now too tight and it is much shorter . thinking about returning it to the store but in any case i can not wear it again ."
__label__0 "one wash wonder ... i 'm a s to m and went with a m but could have gone with a s with ease . after washing it was way shorter . it shrunk more than a whole size in cold water ! i assumed everything came preshrunk but sadly disappointed . great for one wear ."
__label__-1 "this has such awful proportions . i 'm 5 ' 0 and 100 lbs ordered xxs petite ( in the neutral color ) . the seam at the bust literally hits in the middle of my bust ! ! it looks very unflattering and it 's very pronounced . i 'm only 5 ' 0 and already the seam hits at such a high point on me . below the seam the sweater is all scrunched up where it 's sewed and it balloons outward and is very square from there down . very shapeless sweater and not flattering at all unless you have your arms by your sides to hi"
__label__1 "these are some of my favorite new pants . i am never disappointed by the quality from this brand and they are super comfortable and adorable . a definite must have !"
__label__-1 "looks great the material feels great but when i put this dress on for the first time today it fell apart at the seams in the rib cage area . total disappointment ! i had purchased this on sale for my graduation and was getting ready to walk out the door when i saw two holes on each side !"
__label__0 "i wanted to love these pants but they were larger than i expected and the fabric is very heavy . almost like a thick sweater ."
__label__1 "i did n't think i would like this blouse when i saw it on the website but once i tried it on i was sold . yes it is see-through but with a cami underneath this blouse can be worn both casually and to work . the best feature ? even though it 's silk and the tag says dry clean only you can absolutely hand wash this blouse in cold water and air dry . i did and it came out perfect with no wrinkles ! i took my usual small ( i 'm 32c and 122 lbs ) and love how versatile this blouse will be ."
__label__0 "i was so excited to try this on -- but this was a big nope for me unfortunately . i ordered both an xs and s ( i normally wear a s ) both hung horribly on me they were just too big . i love a boxy oversized silhouette but this sadly did n't flatter me in the least ."
__label__0 "i bought the pink one . i like this salmon pink color ! not too girly type of pink . the material is super soft and light . i have skinny torso so it looks really nice on me not showing thin body ... the only thing that disappointed me was it shrunk after the first wash ... it shrunk one size ! when i bought it ( size s ) it covered my flat hips fits just like the picture but now my hips are showing : ( i recommend getting a size up if you are too lazy to wash cold & air dry ."
__label__0 "i 've been eyeing this top up in the floral pattern for a while and finally ordered it when i had 15 % off . i really do n't think it 's worth the price and it 's not very flattering . i think it would look better on someone less busty - it seemed to accent my bust . it 's definitely not my favorite piece and unfortunately i will be returning ."
__label__0 "the white is completely sheer . i am so tired of see through shirts ! ! even at the sale on top of sale prices i would n't recommend this shirt . if the fabric were n't sheer it would be a very comfy shirt with a cute back . but it just looks silly with a tank top under it the cotton just does n't lay right ."
__label__1 "this tee is so soft and comfy . it looks nicer than a regular tee but still casual . fits true to size and not too loose but not too clingy . i know i 'll wear this one a lot !"
__label__0 "the top is a pretty and has a nice pattern . it does run large and is it a bit billowy . i am 5 ' 4 petite and ordered a small ( maybe the xs would have been better ) . however the top swallowed me up and was unflattering . the colors are true to the picture .. not very bright but would be a nice transition to fall top . the feel of the blouse was nice and maybe if i was taller and ordered a smaller size it would have been better ."
__label__1 "i have had my eye on this dress since the spring ( in yellow ) but it sold out quickly . i jumped on this dress as soon as i saw it come out in different colors this fall ! i purchased the peach color and it is really lovely . i will be wearing this dress for family photos . the lace and the details are so very pretty ! i am usually a size 0 or 2 and purchased in size 2 since there is no stretch to it . it is a beautiful dress and i highly recommend it ! wish it came in white !"
__label__-1 "this is way cuter on the model . it runs so big that it is very unflattering . perhaps on someone tall it would look better but sadly it looked dumpy on my 5 ' 2 frame . it also arrived with some black stain on it . it is going back ."
__label__0 "thought this looked so cute especially for averting frame . it arrived and was too large the fabric felt super cheap and the lace detail on the shoulders was very prominent .... and not in a good way . returned ."
__label__-1 "unfortunately the dress is pulling apart after the first wash ( gentle hand wash cycle ) . also there are no bra-straps holders and my bra straps did show up a lot ..."
__label__1 "beautiful colors . lightweight flannel so a great pair of sleep pants that can be worn year round . i ordered a s my typical size which turned out to be quite large on me . hopefully the xs will fit better ."
__label__0 "ordered this vest in both the xs and pxs . i liked the length and overall fit of the xs however i ended up returning both due to how the vest draped . the outer fabric is a bit more stiff which made the vest balloon out more then what i liked . overall it ? s not a terrible vest but just not for me ."
__label__1 "this dress is so gorgeous ! it fits perfectly is stretchy wonderful comfortable and the fabric is nice and thick with beautiful texture . i absolutely love it ! i 'm 5 ' 6 125 lbs with a pretty athletic build and it fits like a dream ! i love the color the fabric the fit the stretch the comfort the sexyness of it ..... it 's my new favorite ! highly recommended !"
__label__0 "i wanted to love this warm dress because the colors and the material are beautiful . unfortunately i could n't make the fit work . for reference i am 5 ' 3 110 pounds and usually wear an xs in retailer clothing . like other reviewers i found the xs to be a bit tight around the arms and i do n't have particularly large arms so i ordered the sp hoping it would be roomier and shorter ( the regular length came down to mid-knee ) . unfortunately the sp was enormous ; it was in no way a petite . it was as l"

__label__0 "i ordered this online and i love the style but did n't like the print as much as i thought i would ."
__label__0 "i ordered this pants in white and black . i read the reviews and were n't that bad . i am 5 ' 6 and 125 lbs . i got them in size small . they are way too big . the small size seems to be xl and they are way too long for someone who is maybe 5 ' 8 or 5 ' 9 . i have to returned them . quality is ok looking on my opinion ."
__label__0 "note : if you have a large chest the seams hit in an unflattering spot . nice shirt just not great for the price ."
__label__-1 "i really loved this in the catalog . the fabric and details are very pretty . however it 's a lot of fabric without much form . my husband suggested it for maternity ( not realizing it has fitted slip ) . not for curvy/ hourglass . had to send it back ."
__label__-1 "huge ! normally wear a medium and this was huge and very unflattering ."
__label__1 "really pretty for summer especially beach and pool wear . but i 'm only 5 ' 1 and even the petite is i think a tad long for flats ( which is my preferred shoe for this dress ) . i 'm also curvy and busty on top so unless you are blessed with a nice thin waist it 's not as flattering as the tall thin model shows . but still it looks nice on and i though it might look good also with white footless tights i have too . so i 'm on the fence about keeping it since it 's really pretty for a summer party ."
__label__0 "the fabric so diaphanous ! so flowy ! the pattern so pretty with such interesting colors . it could literally go with anything ! purple yellow orange green they 're all in there . but here 's the but .... i have no waist ! and when you put this type of empire silhouette on me i look like i 'm wearing a sack or i have some pregnancy news -- when i do n't . i tried belting it : waist tie is too high ; i tried putting on a vest too annie hall and called too much attention to the sleeves while adding"
__label__-1 "the fabric and cut of this blouse are beautiful but the v was so deep i could never wear it without a cami and i think that would ruin the look . i have a large chest but the similarly cut blouse ( without the textured fabric - from the same designer ) fit me fine . this one is just cut differently . i even tried sizing up and down - to no avail . the photo on the model seems misleading because i do n't see how the neck would lay flat or stay that high on anyone - even with a smaller chest . i was so"
__label__0 "saw online and had to have . got it home and i was swimming in it ! i normally am a size l in most retailer brands but this felt so large ! the actual top is lovely with an airy artistic quality to it . not sure if i will go back for the medium or not ."
__label__1 "i had been on a white jeans hunt for some time . pilcro is one of my favorite brands and i can buy online with confidence knowing they will fit . if petite had been available that would have been better in length but it was not so i had them hemmed ."
__label__1 "this top is such a great color and style . i did have to go a size down as i typically wear a medium . the style is very forgiving . it looks great with shorts and jeans ! it 's staple !"
__label__1 "while the blue color pictured is stunning i purchased the white poplin in store . two best features ? the ruffle on the neckline continues across the back and dips into a small v ( a great detail especially for short or swept-up hair during summer months ) . next this white fabric 's crisp finish is coupled with a just right weight ( solid enough to be opaque but light enough for warm days ) . plan to pair it with skinny jeans throughout spring and summer . thrilled !"
__label__0 "so this shirt is adorable . soft fun lays nicely ... but you should have your arms amputated and replaced with a barbie 's before you put it on . i do n't even have large arms the medium fit me perfectly but then like i hulked out the arms and there are now little tears at the seams . this was all very confusing and vexing as this shirt is otherwise perfection . i mean i 'm not a large ? but i guess if i want this shirt i will need to take it back and get a large otherwise it will be sleev"
__label__1 "love this coat - great fall piece ! i bought the green color and it looks as shown in the picture . great retailer purchase !"
__label__0 "the front and back of this square sweater are the same and the pattern of the stitching makes it look like it 's on backwards.the lace would be nice but it 's itchy . and the sweater is cropped so i think the layered lace look is odd because the whole thing is so short on the body . the 3/4 sleeves make it look small and fitted but the body shape is bulky . just could n't get it to work ."
__label__-1 "i know this product description says oversized but that 's an understatement . i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father 's jacket . i do n't even think an xs would have worked . i 'm 5 ' 6 and about 135 pounds for reference . i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it 's just way too big ."
__label__0 "super cute top ! thin ! ! would look great layered ! not crazy how it looked by itself !"

__label__-1 "this dress is just too baggy overall . i am 5 ' 6 140 lbs and a size small was so unflattering . i ca n't go down in size because the waist detail will get too high on me . it was already a little high on the small ."
__label__-1 "i ordered the black and white pattern which was ok. i got a small but the shirt was very square - with a short and wide fit ! i doubt an xs would have helped with such a boxy shirt . sent this one back ."
__label__-1 "i loved this color and ordered it online because i thought it would work for both casual and work days dressed up a little . ummmmm no . it 's weird and boxy and does not look at all like it does on the model . i think maybe if you have no bust whatsoever and size way down it would look okay . i 'm only a 34b weigh 110 pounds 5 ' 3 and it made me look huge and awkward . this is going back !"
__label__1 "the look quality and feel of this jacket is perfect . it does run a large so i would order a size down . i definitely worth every penny ."
__label__-1 "i fell in love with this cute top however after reading reviews i am going to return it . seems there is a problem with it shrinking after following washing instructions . who wants to dry clean a tank top ? not me sadly . too bad . style was cute and color was awesome ."
__label__0 "i ordered this on-line . while it fits well before washing the fabric is a bit thin . i 'm afraid it might shrink in the wash too . i have n't worn it yet because i 'm trying to decide it i will keep it or return it . colors are a bit more muted than i would like also ."
__label__1 "i was n't expecting much out of this when i was in the store but liked the colors and thought i 'd try it out . grabbed a s and xs ( i 'm usually a s in everything but maeve is weird sometimes ) - the s fit perfectly ( tts ) and the xs felt tight in the shoulder seam as well as in the armpit . it does have a detachable slip/liner that may be too fitted for some of you are prone to that issue . in the model shot i think the horizontal seam at the swing portion looks higher than it was on me ... falling low"
__label__-1 "this top is absolutely gorgeous but i followed the care tag to a t and it completely fell apart in the wash. will be returning ."
__label__-1 "i ordered a small which is my usual retailer size but this was like a tent on me . it 's fine if you like things super super blousey but that was n't what i was looking for . also it is very long a very weird amount of long . also there is only eyelet on the front . the whole back of the shirt is just plain fabric . i like the idea of this shirt but all in all it was very disappointing ."
__label__1 "love this top i would have bought two but the grey is sold out in my size . very comfortable and true to size ."
__label__1 "i ordered an extra small . it fits with both a humble tee and a button down with the sleeves rolled up . i 've tried it with jeans and also joggers and heels . really a cute and versatile sweater . i got the olive but can see where the black might be more universally useful . this one works perfectly for me however"
__label__0 "i tried this on in a store and it was beautiful except the sizing was way off . i 'm 5'11 and usually a 12 or 14. the 12 was skin-tight and the 14 was so loose it was comical - and even on my super long legs the cuffs dragged on the floor . plus the lacy panels in the cleavage area are totally see-through and my bra was very visible . i was totally bummed . also incidentally this did n't seem the best quality . there were strings hanging out of the lacy areas and the waist tie ties way higher than"

__label__-1 "i ordered two sizes . when the package came i was skeptical as it was very light and thin . both shirts were in the bag . the style is just okay . the shirt is extremely light weight . i was not impressed with the fabric . i am returning both . definitely did not think it was worth the price ."
__label__0 "this lift weight cardigan is true to size perfect for fall or spring . colors are quite nice especially the little pops of orange ."
__label__-1 "description is wrong . not a swing tunic . more long and straight . keep that in mind when buying this . if you have hips this might not be the top for you"
__label__-1 "tried this on in store . was ill-fitting and sheer ."
__label__-1 "but it runs super small . i wear a medium for everything but could n't come close to buttoning this . the buttons were about 4 inches apart ( horizontally ) probably should have ordered an extra large in order to fit . the quality and styling seemed great but ordering online requires truth in sizing"
__label__1 "i like these jeans . when i wore them i received compliments . they do run large . i sized down one size but probably could have sized down two sizes . they feel tight when you first put them on but as you wear them they loosen up and i find myself pulling them up to meet my waist . my other complaint is a small one . the embroidered flower on the knee rubs against your knee as you move . after awhile my right knee felt like it had a carpet burn on it . that is why i gave this only 4 stars for desi"
__label__1 "i read the rave reviews but tried this on with low expectations . i am curvier on top so i thought the dress would make my chest look huge and show my tummy budges . the dress was the exact opposite - so flattering and a piece i could truly dress up or down . i am 5 ' 6 135lbs and a small fit perfectly . i rarely purchase anything at full price but plan to circle back to my local retailer to pick this up today ."

__label__0 "i really like how this looks on the model but in real life this top is much tighter . i was hoping for a good layering top and have been playing around with the trend of lace up tops . i bought it without trying on figuring a small would work but it was much too tight and the lace top reminded me of vans shoes . i returned it a girl much tinier than myself has it and it is very cute on her . so best works on a model body type figure than someone with even slight hips ."
__label__0 "i ordered this dress in two sizes pxs and ps . they both arrived in a timely manner but the pxs was snagged upon arrival . there were a few other reviewers that stated the dress snagged easily but i loved the classic look of this dress so i thought i would take the chance . unfortunately i had to take both back to the store because the potential for snagging the fabric was too high even considering the sale price . also the dress comes with a cotton slip but the slip for the pxs was tiny while the"

__label__1 "while overall it 's a pretty top there were a few surprises . the biggest one not listed is that the bottom has a thin elastic band ! without it the top would be wide longer and flow . in the picture to get it to the length shown the elastic is pulled up toward the waist . which could work for some as you can adjust the length into a tucked in look . it could be cut off and sewn making a normal flowy top . i am a normal size 6 and the shoulders are off and the sleeve length is long with elastic"
__label__1 "easy to wear and very cute especially for curvy ladies . but i think it looks best worn with a best or a blazer on top something to emphasize the waist a bit more ."
__label__1 "this shirt is just precious ! i can not wait to pair it with a pair of white skinny jeans and wedges in the spring . i 'm so in love with it . the detail is just beautiful ."
__label__1 "i am in love with this dress . ordered online in both my usual 4 and 6 ( i go back and forth ) and this time i kept the six . there is a little bit of stretch to the fabric but it has nice structure and the cap sleeves make it a welcome addition to my wardrobe . i plan on wearing this as a day-to-night dress since it 's appropriate for work and for an evening out ."
__label__1 "love this blouse in yellow ! fit is true to size and it looks a feels great ."
__label__-1 "i 'm not sure why this dress is getting great reviews . the plunging neckline is ridiculous and ran down to the underwire of my bra and the slit up the side came up to the upper part of my thigh . it was one of the worst fitting/cut dresses i 've every tried on at retailer . i 'm 5 ' 4 125. maybe you have to be 6 feet tall and 90 pounds for this dress to not look like a bad renaissance faire costume ."
__label__1 "i bought this top to add some more color and pattern to my summer wardrobe . it is really cute and a flattering cut . i just had a baby so it 's perfect for showing some curves without clinging . if anything i 'd say it maximizes my bustline more than i expected but is still very flattering . i think i 'm still getting used to my new bustline ; ) soft comfy fabric . not too hot . i get compliments when i wear it !"
__label__0 "i read the reviews before i bought this dress and had trouble believing that the dress literally fell apart at the seams so i bought it . first the good : i love the color the fabric and the design . it 's very lightweight and loose-fitting and is perfect for hot days . the neck and sleeves are pretty on . i can wear it as a cover up or put on a necklace and sandals for everyday errands and things . now the bad : it literally falls apart at the seams as you take it out of the package ! im surprised a"
__label__-1 "wow ! this sure is close fitting as in suction cups to your body ! yikes definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves . to me it seems like the material will wear well . i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it not sure . it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs it wo n't work . i ordered the medium and am usually a small . the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy . i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas ."
__label__1 "flattering ! i love how it looks like a maxi dress . fits me perfectly !"
__label__0 "really wanted to love this especially with the lacing and long length for this off-the-shoulder top . when the top arrived the lacing was stiff and length of the straps were long so that the bottom of the lace did n't completely cover my black strapless bra ( and i felt it sat a bit too low down my chest ) . thought about taking in the straps but then the area around the armpits would be uncomfortable . i did love the length of the top though . wish this top was a keeper but going to have to return ."

__label__0 "this dress had so much promise from the picture . i loved the midi length color and fascinating waist detail . i ordered online so there was no way to try on before purchasing . the fit was disappointing . it fell in an unflattering manner at every point ; a tad too low at the waist ; a tad too long at the shin . just kind of saggy all around . bummed but this is not to say it would n't fit someone with a different body shape better . the quality of fabric is nice and the color is lovely ."
__label__1 "this is really a gorgeous blouse . the design is very feminine and elegant and fits true to size . i did n't think it ran short and the material is light and airy . it sold out so quickly so i had to wait awhile and managed to get my hands on a 4 when it was available for a quick second . it was def . worth the wait . a gorgeous top ."
__label__-1 "i just received this in the mail today . first of all there was no slip included and the fabric is totally sheer . the description says viscose lining so i assume there was a slip and from the picture it looks like it was a beige color . second of all it was obviously sent from a store where they lost the slip and it was squished into the smallest possible retailer envelope . the fabric is beautiful but the dress is humongous like the previous reviewers said . i ordered a size smaller than us"
__label__1 "these are so comfortable it 's like wearing jammies outside . i love the pattern and you really ca n't be the comfort ."
__label__-1 "i was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail . the picture looks much cuter than in person . although it 's true to size it looks pretty baggy on . also i thought the grey ( top ) and blue ( bottom ) were too similarly colored ; more contrast would have been nice . i 'm returning this item ."
__label__1 "i purchased this dress to wear to a horse race but will also be wearing it all summer long ! the material is light weight and has a vintage flare to the print . the button in the center of the dress add an extra detail that keeps the dress pretty and casual ."
__label__0 "when ordering this product i thought it was strange that the mediums were sold out . i went with the small which is generally what i wear . however these run small and i see why the medium ran out . they are pretty however i wish they made them more true to size ."
__label__-1 "this top is huge ! i 'm typically a size 2 or 4. i bought the 2 and its huge . it 's wider than it is long . even if i sized down to a 0 it would still be too much fabric . i 'm so disappointed ! beautiful color and fabric but there 's so much fabric . i love a flowy top but this one is way too much . : ( i will be returning this top ."
__label__-1 "i thought this top was so cute but when i tried it on it is so big on the bottom it looks like a tent . i normally wear a l or xl and took it back to the store to try on a medium and that one fit better but the bottom was still too big . sad ."

__label__-1 "this skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo . i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big but nothing that affected the look of the skirt . the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together almost like sunday school felt cut outs ( but stiffer ) ( not a fan ) .. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple and the color washed me out . definitely not worth the price ( for me anyways ) . good luck !"
__label__0 "i decided to take advantage of the free shipping despite seeing no reviews yet . i received the dress today and it is exactly as pictured only about 3 inches shorter . i am usually between an xs and s but chose the xs because of late everything i seem to order is huge . this was an exception and i could have ordered the s. color was as pictured a nice green . fabric was a gauzy cotton . the dress was just alright . nothing special to warrant the price tag . it felt like a little girl 's dress on me"
__label__1 "these jeans are beautiful . as the other reviewers have noted ... they run very large ... like 2 sizes even then they are very stretchy . the embroidery is dark blue ( looks black on screen ) .... lovely pair of jeans . if they had other colors i would by them !"

__label__1 "excellent quality blouse and sooo pretyy ! ! i was worried when i saw on-line that is 100 % cotton . i though it was a cotton blouse that would get wrinkly . but i was pleasantly surprised when i saw it in the store ! it is a substantial weight cotton/gauze that looks like hand stitched embroidery . i 'd say it fits tts ."
__label__0 "i ordered this skirt because the 4 i tried on in store was huge and the 2 was way too small . the sizing was an issue so i thought i would try another 4. the skirt that arrived by mail was so wrinkled it was obvious that a day of wear would turn it into a nightmare of unflattering creases and stretched out areas . i like the concept of the design with the button front and a-line princess seams in the front and back but i just feel the fabric in this skirt has too much stretch . i returned it ."
__label__0 "i was really excited for this dress to come and hoped it would work well for a couple of holiday parties that i will be going to this season . i was n't sure what i thought when trying it on but i am thinking it will go back since i still am not super excited about it . for me the waistline was a bit high and it had a bit of a frumpy feel . i love the floral pattern but overall it just was n't amazing ."

__label__1 "i loved the print on both but first bought the blue to check out the fit and feel . i went ahead and ordered the cat one today . the fit is relaxed and slightly oversized so if you want a slimmer or less boxy fit size down . for myself m was perfect since i 'm built larger and broader on top . the top is a bit long covers my hips and some of my bottom . it 's a mixed fabric design so the linen part may feel scratchy to sensitive types ."
__label__1 "finding boyfriend jeans that actually look flattering can be tricky . these fit the bill ! not too baggy with a lovely side view silhouette and a front silhouette that does not make you look larger than you actually are - i instantly knew that i had to have these . look supercute with the legs rolled up or as shown in the picture . the denim is soft and the creasing and finish do not look too contrived . i sized down a size and the fit is perfect . highly recommend !"
__label__0 "i agree with the other reviewers ; this sweater was strangly shaped in the waist in an unflattering way . the rest of it was beautiful though . looks too much like maternity even in a petite xs so it 's going back ."
__label__1 "i normally wear a 4 and that technically fit if i did n't plan to sit . i went a size up and it was still gorgeous but now i could breathe . it is incredibly sexy yet sophisticated my husband is always asking why i need another dress and when he saw me in he fitting room his eyes lit up and he said you definitely need to get this dress . needless to say i 'll wear it on our next date .."
__label__0 "this shirt is really cute and runs large . i am a true s and this shirt came as big as what i would call an l. i get that its a boyfriend t-shirt feel but it was still surprising . if you 're an s i suggest xxs and so forth . the color is yellow but not as yellow as the picture shows ."
__label__0 "the color and embellishment of this top are beautiful . this would look great on anyone super lean otherwise you just look really wide as there is no frame in the torso of this top at all . the back picture shows it well . i am 5 ' 9 142 lbs and i ordered the small and medium and both were huge ! with regrets going back ."

__label__0 "i love the look and feel of this easy dress . i loved that it comes with a baby blue slip however i was in between sizes . the medium - a bit too small and the large- just too big . this dress is probably best in a tall thin body type especially in a madras plaid ."

__label__1 "beautiful dress but works best with a belt where the dress cinches at the high waist . it runs huge : i 'm 5 ' 6 and a m/l but the small petite is what looks and fits the best . there is a lot of unnecessary fabric and stretch at the waist . i received a lot of compliments on this dress ! glad i kept trying on smaller sizes ."
__label__0 "though the quality is good and the fabric is both sturdy and soft the cut of this top made this a no-go for me . it 's a bit short in front and also boxy which is emphasized by the dolman sleeves . i ordered the coral color and it was much brighter - almost neon-y - as opposed to the soft salmon color my screen shows . i regretfully returned it ."
__label__0 "this top is adorable and has a looser fit ( as shown on the model shot ) so i would have liked to size down ; however the arms are extremely fitted/tight and there 's no way i could have fit my arms into the next size down . if you have slim arms maybe you could size down and make this work ."

( the red also shows a fair amount of the armpit area but ( barely ) covers my bra . the material is somewhat thinner than expected but not so sheer that a skin-toned bra would n't be sufficient ."

__label__1 "this is ruching done right ! i tried this dress on and the two other women who saw me in it went to try it on as well . it is fitted but comfortable and because it is well cut the ruching hides a multitude of sins to leave you looking sleek and curvy in all the right places . it is also a versatile layering piece and would look great with almost anything . so unless this particular color is your nemesis this dress is a winner !"

__label__0 "this vest is very nice and fashionable very stylish . i like it a lot . however it is too itchy . the opening in the front did n't allow me to close as many buttons as i like but i would totally wear this stylish vest even though it is not as functional when it is cold . however the itchiness is too much . i do n't wear wool unless it is ultra soft or mixed with cashmere so i could not imaging wearing this vest it is too itchy . why ruin such a good thing ?"

__label__1 "this top is really cute . the fabric is soft with a little stretch to it . the lace shoulders with the denim cutouts add so much to this top . i was afraid it might make it too stiff & bulky around the shoulders but it does n't . very cute . the armholes are cut on the bigger side but not so big that it shows your bra strap or anything . ( just comfortable ) the cut is also very nice and the pleats make it more body slimming . runs pretty tts . i ordered my usual medium and it 's not quite as form fitting"
__label__-1 "it was huge . material looked good but was too bulky . will be returning it ."

__label__-1 "i ordered this skirt because it looked cute and versatile . when it arrived the pleat in front ( shown in the center ) was far to the right so the overall look was crooked . not sure if it was a quality control issue or if that 's the true design but it will have to go back . too bad because i had high hopes !"
__label__-1 "it 's pretty floaty feminine ; the photos do n't do justice to the prettiness . but the photos also do n't show an asymmetrical hem . i understood it runs small so i got two sizes to be safe and even my larger size was strangely short-waisted and i 'm short-waisted to start with . maybe i could 've lived with that but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any i 've ever worn or seen before . it 's not longer on just the sides ; the hem is longer in one spot on the front and one in the"

__label__0 "the quality and color is great on this top . the neckline just seemed a be pulled a little too tight on the one side of my neck to be a true off-the -shoulder look . and to wear it as a cowl neck ( or actually looks like a boat neck ) just makes it too ordinary- since i love the off the shoulder look . it fit me everywhere else and the slim waistline of this top is super flattering- so i think my size was right . the cut of the neckline just needed to be more more definitive one way or the other ."
__label__1 "i 'm 7months preggars and this top actually compliments my belly . extremely comfortable ."
__label__-1 "there is n't a whole lot that i did like about this dress . the shoulders have large poufs the fabric is n't very soft and it 's not flattering . maybe with a belt i could be tempted but i was n't too fond of the dress ."
__label__0 "after seeing this dress online and noticing how quickly it sold out i was curious about it but thought i was out of luck . it just so happened that i ran into the store and they had one returned in my size . i tried it and was n't sold . however i loved the color . it was snug across the shoulders and arms . the rest was somewhat flowy but boxy at the same time . i ended up bringing it home to think on it . after trying it on again i realized the snugness across the shoulder really caused the top t"
__label__1 "this is such an easy dress to wear and it looks very polished ! it is not a cheap polyester fabric as one reviewer wrote . it is a rayon and nylon blend . it does wrinkle easily . i love that the belt is actually sewn into the dress at the back . i do n't typically gravitate toward warm color palette but the burnt orange color is really lovely . it can be dressed up or down very easily . and it has pockets ! i typically wear xs in retailer brands and the size 0 fit me well ."
__label__0 "i 'm glad this was on sale because i would not have purchased it at full price due to the strange fit in the sleeve . the shirt has a slight raglan sleeve but the sleeves do not fit loosely they kind of twist under the armpit area . i do not have large arms so i am ok with straightening out the knit sleeves but they do not fit right . i also was surprised at the unfinished edge along the neckline . it is messy and tacky looking but i think that is how it was meant to be . my recommendation to buy"
__label__0 "the picture makes it looks like it has rich brown yellow and orange colors . when it came it was more black with some orange that popped . much different then i expected . the material was nice and silky but i was not willing to keep something that was dry clean only . i sent it back ."
__label__1 "love love love this top . it 's got a little bit of a native american vibe without being over-the-top . i tend to wear a small in retailer but the medium was the way to go for me . it 's not long and the style errs on the not-tight side . if you can go between two sizes do n't get the smaller one . and i love the shade of yellow !"
__label__1 "i originally bought these jeans in my true size . after wearing them a few times i realized they stretched out quickly making it hard to wear them again . retailer recommended i go down a size and now they are my favorite jean ! they are a little tight for the first 5 mins and then they are perfect fit wear after wear . and so soft !"
__label__1 "this dress is so flattering on i was astounded . often the waistline in the petite dress are very high even though i 'm only 5 ' 1 tall but this one hit at the right place and the skirt made me feel slim and tall . the fabric feels silky and the pattern is nice but it is a pretty conservative style and perhaps a bit dark for spring . would be great for work or church but unfortunately does n't really fit my lifestyle and i personally prefer a more unique style for the price . i highly recommend"
__label__0 "this dress is very cute ! i loved it . the quality is excellent . however the fit is off . i 'm 51 107lbs 32c . this dress was roomy in the bust and was a little too broad shouldered . it was tight around the waist . this caused creasing and buldging in the back . the color is much more vibrant in person . i would have kept it if it fit properly ."
__label__-1 "it was so cute in the pictures and i was looking for something to wear to my trip to europe so i purchased it but it really did n't live up to my expectations . i 'm 5 ' 3 115 and got a s. it looked odd on me ... a little too short on the bottom a bit too big on top and overall i thought the material looked cheap for the price . i returned it ."

__label__1 "i have a short torso and short arms so i purchased this in a petite medium . i probably could 've worn the ps but i do like the little extra room . it is a classic shirt dress with just enough of today 's trendy frayed edge to make it contemporary . the fabric is super soft and lays nicely . i can imagine wearing this through the seasons with a variety of shoes/legwear & accessories ! looking forward to it ."
__label__0 "this pant is beautiful and fits great except for the waist . it is too big . i carry all my extra weight in my waist too . 5 ' 6 1/2 150lbs straight and up down figure . the waist gapped in the back almost 2 inches . otherwise this is a great pant if you have a well developed bootie maybe they would fit . ordered a 10 by the way . if they make it to sale will purchase again and take to tailor . they are a well constructed lovely pant ."
__label__1 "love this piece . it is warm and attractive and will set any outfit off from a dress to jeans and a t-shirt . i look forward to wearing it often ."
__label__0 "so the dress is interesting . has an asymmetrical wrap look short sexy length ( i 'm 5 ' 3 and the petite barely covers my assets ) and a neckline that implies sexy without actually displaying the girls- it crosses over and stays closed but looks sexy and plunging . but the shoulders are what make it look matronly . they 're wide- from neck out to the outer edge of my shoulder/upper arm . they show no shoulder at all which is really an odd design when the rest of the dress is sexy-ish . i looked back"
__label__0 "i bought this shirt in white and am happy with the fact that it 's not too sheer . the back detail is great . my only complaint is that it is too long . i got the small and it fits nicely in the arms and top but it is much longer on me than on the model . i 'm 5 ' 5 tall . it does n't look great when i do a half tuck but it looks fine if i tuck it all the way in . maybe an xs would have been a better fit ."

__label__-1 "i really love the pattern and the look on the model and i thought i would love it . i ordered online so i did not try on in store . when i tried it on it has way too much fabric around the waist and skirt . it is thick fabric as well and has a lining and the waist has extra fabric for the design and it has pockets so it all adds up to be way too bulky . it is not flattering at all and made me look 10 pounds heavier . i am returning this dress . sad because it looks so lovely on the model . i am"
__label__0 "i also wanted to love this top but sadly had to return it because it is very short and the peplum piece is very wide . it was not flattering at all ."

__label__-1 "when the top arrived and i tried it on ; it was great . the length was perfect even though i am curvy . after one wash ( done according to the directions ) the top shrank in length considerably . i do not mind paying a higher price for something unique and something of quality ..... i do have a problem with something that does not hold up to basic use . i will be returning this item ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this as it seemed like a fun and carefree take on a little black dress . but how did i not see that this has tassels ? but they 're there a whole row of them - look hear the bottom of the skirt part between the colorful stripes and the lacy area . that 's a deal breaker for me - i really ca n't stand the way these look and they 're not the sort of thing you can easily remove . the fabric though nice quality has no stretch at all . i was n't expecting stretch but i 'd just say"
__label__1 "i agree with the other reviewer this skirt is has beautiful print combed cotton with a sheen . it is kind of stiff with a little give a perfect a line . the waist is a little tight so i sized up usually wear a 2 and the 4 was perfect for me . wore it to a show last night and was super comfortable and pretty all in one ."
__label__0 "this sweater is incredibly soft and pretty but there is just no way to get it to lay the way the model does in the picture . i found myself constantly tugging at the top to get it to stay off the shoulder - otherwise it just bunched up top and make a weird funnel neck . i really wanted it to work but it was just so impractical ."
__label__0 "i had mixed feelings about this dress . the material is lovely but the skirt is really odd . it has two slips one that fits close and a second that 's a bit too puffy . so the skirt did n't sit well and i thought it made my hips look bigger . the odd length made it unflattering . it might be nicer without the puffy slip but i did n't want to risk it ."
__label__0 "loved these pants when i tried them on they looked great and felt so comfortable . when i washed according to the directions on the tag the bottom of one leg lost so much color that i ca n't wear them anymore .. so disappointed !"
__label__1 "fits perfect . i 'm 5 ' 3 and the size 2 regular fit perfect . not too long it too short just perfect ."
__label__1 "the design and colors on this sweater arguably make it a statement sweater . it has a modified raglan type sleeve . i found the sleeves to fit just fine . for reference i am 5 ' 9 150 lbs . 34dddd and the medium fit perfectly . it is not a long sweater and with my height i wear a long tank top or cami underneath . i love the way it looks ."
__label__-1 "the model looks awesome in this cute top but on me it looked boxy but was too tight around the chest and was too short ( for reference i 'm 5 ' 7 140 lbs . and 34c ) . the front is non-stretchy eyelet lace cotton fabric yet the back is stretchy . in theory it 's pretty but in reality it does n't work - at least for me . i think it might work for someone petite with a smaller chest ."
__label__0 "beautiful detail soft drapey fabric . but it pulls funny from where they added stitching at the top of the v. for me it was also a little short but i have a long torso . i 'm 5 ' 7 155lbs and the size medium fit nicely with the exception of the length ."
__label__-1 "the fit is so bad and the construction is very poor . i 'm 5 ' 1 '' 100 lbs ordered xxs petite . first of all when i button this there is extreme gaping going on . the vest runs narrow yet tall ? it shifts up my torso if i move at all making the gaping even worse . the skirt at the bottom is made of a very cheap thin slightly sheeny material that you would find at a flea market . it arrived unbelievably wrinkled and crumpled and it was just so thin . it did not meet as closely in the middl"
__label__-1 "well i wanted to love it and it was just too much . i think it is a bit wider and weirdly baggier than it should be . i also feel it should be fully lined . it was not . the exterior wool and pattern is very nice . maybe if it was lined a smaller size would have worked better but for the price i needed more . i also would have liked some sort of option for tightening the waist a bit when zipped up . i realize this is n't in the picture so no expectation but upon trying it on and seeing its boxines"
__label__1 "easy to wear get lots of compliments when i wear it . can be dressed up or down"
__label__1 "super cute and simple shirt ( as other reviewer said lol ) . but she was right ! i have another shirt from this brand and it 's one of my favorites . it runs true to size . it 's a nice casual wear with jeans kind of shirt and great for fall . it may be a little short for someone with a long torso and/or tall as i 'm only 5 ' 2 and i would n't want it to be any shorter ."
__label__1 "love this dress and the color"
__label__0 "i agree with the other two reviews . it is so disappointing that this adorable dress is n't lined . the fabric is paper thin ! this is an a-line style dress with pockets that need to be ironed down to prevent it making you look hippy . i sized down to a petite xs . i normally buy the petite smalls but they were out of it . i would say that this dress runs a little on the large size ."
__label__1 "i was attracted to this sweater because of it 's unique style . i really love it . it looks just like the picture . it is of good quality as is the leather belt . it is the perfect fall sweater and i love that it 's different . i highly recommend this sweater ."
__label__1 "i 'm keeping this dress but it 's going straight to the dry cleaner because right out of the bag it has a very strong chemical smell ... like it had been stored in a gas station . then i 'm replacing all the buttons . the fabric is a thick eyelet folded over with these teeny thin shell buttons that are a complete design fail . two were broken right out of the package . also i 'm a size 0 in most retailer dresses and this dress has plenty of room in the waist almost too much space but the top ... i hav"
__label__0 "cute pattern but the shirt is very thin and runs small and short !"
__label__0 "relaxed fit soft and comfortable . interesting design but material is extremely thin . if i had purchased this at full price i probably would have returned it . it seems more like a pajama top ..."
__label__0 "i agree with a previous reviewer who said that it was very nicely cut but unfortunately the materials are so cheap . the fleece material that it is made out of feels like the cheap polyester fleece blankets that you get at the discount stores . it will pill easily and is noticeable even in the dark color . i must have gotten one shipped straight from the store and it was already starting to do some gnarly pilling . i do love the cut of it but i ca n't justify keeping it because this wo n't last"
__label__1 "i 've been looking for a staple long-sleeve tee for a while now and i think i 've found it ! i bought this tee in my usual retailer size of medium and the fit is perfect . the material is soft the cut highlights an hourglass figure without clinging in the wrong places . the sleeves are long enough which can sometimes be a problem for me . the length is perfect to wear with leggings without being too long . i 'll be back for more colors !"
__label__1 "i absolutely love this dress ... tried it on one size down from my usual ... it fit but my size would be perfect and 8 and 10 are out of stock . it 's stunning and i love it ... i badly have to have it ... please bring it back retailer : )"
__label__1 "this shirt is so comfortable and soft . it has a great fit . it is a little thin but i can get away with wearing it by itself . i love it !"
__label__1 "cute staple in classic style overall . fabric weight is good will be able to get by with nude bra . many wardrobe options with this staple ."
__label__1 "highly recommend these jeans ! they are ultra-soft and fit your body like a dream . the wash is flattering on them as well . i was looking for a pair of jeans to be my go to and ultimately landed on these . they do runa little big but they do not stretch out much so i went with my usual size ."
__label__-1 "this sweater/jacket looks just like the photo in real life but the inside is so scratchy . i physically recoiled when trying it on as the interior of the sleeves feels like sandpaper . unlined and uncomfortable . no thank you ! should you choose to proceed i found the fit tts . i 'm 5 ' 8 wear an 8/10 and the medium worked for me ."
__label__-1 "i totally agree with the last reviewer . i 'm 5 ' 2 115 pounds with somewhat wide shoulders . the x-small fit my torso but was so tight in my shoulders i could n't move my arms . the small was better but was too big in the torso . the material itself was really nice . too bad the fit was so awkward and unflattering ."
__label__1 "this sweater is so beautiful on . it is thick material but does not make you look boxy . it fits so nicely and is flattering . the design is just gorgeous . if you are considering this sweater -- get it you wo n't regret it ! i 'm normally a small ( 4-6 ) and i ordered a small . it fits true to size . the fit is * perfect * so if you want it slightly more relaxed order one size up ."
__label__1 "i am 5 ' 4 and 120 lbs and ordered a size 0. the dress fit perfectly in the shoulders and arms and below the waist but i could barely fit my 32a size chest in the dress ! the other reviewers are not kidding about the chest area being very narrow . i have had to order a size 2 instead . we 'll see if that works ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to like this top especially because of its comfortable material and color but the asymmetrical shape did n't hang well on me . it also runs big - i got a small and although the bodice fit okay the sleeves were long and the bottom of the top looked mishaped and dumpy . this top will be going back ."
__label__0 "very high quality dress . there are two layers ( the under navy and over white crochet ) which makes this worth the price . however it is very straight making the dress fit like a bag if you have hips or boobs . tried petite and regular and both were too baggy even in xs ."
__label__-1 "i thought this would look great with skirts but all my skirts are too dressy for this t-shirt . that 's really all it is -- a nothing-special t-shirt . and it runs so big ! i 'm usually a large or xl in tops but for this one i bought a medium and it 's still too big . i think a small would have been fine . but as i mentioned it does n't go with any of my skirts so it 's not worth looking for a small ."
__label__0 "loved the print/pattern and the light grey ..... i think it might have been better if reversed ( it has a v in the back and the front neckline was very intrusive and scratchy to me ) . i 'm normally a small but got this in a medium and it was very short on me . wish it could have worked but returning it ."
__label__0 "i really thought i would love this dress the style is really nice and the material is great . however the length made me feel like i looked short and kind of stumpy . i feel like this dress would look really good on somebody that is more like 6ft not my 5 ' 6 self ."
__label__1 "i loved the mustard colored version of this skirt for summer and was thrilled to see it reissued in darker hues . same comfortable fit and cool textured fabric that does n't wrinkle . i found the regular sizing to still be above the knee and the wide elastic waistband great for either a cropped top or a belt . will wear often ."
__label__-1 "on me thsi was ginormous looked like a mu mu . it is pretty but there was just too much fabric even in the smallest size . the quality seems nice and it looks pretty but overwhelming . i will say i think it would work on tail lean people i have pretty muscular shoulders so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look 30 pounds heavier no joke . fabric is soft though . give it a try just not for me ... ref : 115 lbs 30dd 26.5 in waist ."
__label__1 "this sweater has a retro feel to it . i like how it hits right at the hips and it 's not too long or not too short . it keeps you warm and it 's a nice alternative to all the drab sweaters that you would usually wear in the fall or winter ."
__label__1 "i agree with the other review that the dress runs big and long but i love it ! it 's very flattering and i have super high wedges that work great with it . i do n't think it runs super big but it 's slightly big . definitely size down if small busted . i wore it out and got a ton of compliments . it 's classy different and hot !"
__label__1 "the material is a medium weight jersey knit that is slightly thicker so it provides enough coverage and support to be flattering without being bulky . i think this dress is true-to-size or maybe runs a little bit big but only by a little bit . i bought a medium and am a size 8 in tops and 10 in pants . the dress hugs nicely on the upper body ( arms chest ribs ) and flares just a little bit on the hips/tummy/butt area . it is forgiving of little bumps or lumps . the scoop neckline is a bit lower tha"

__label__-1 "this top is quite boxy and i was very disappointed with the color it looked as if i 'd washed it in filthy water . it 's a very dingy white needless to say it went back ."
__label__-1 "loved these in store when i tried them on but was in between sizes so i ordered them in the larger size . boy do i regret that ! these stretch out so much i have to wear a belt with them and it gives me this saggy bunchy front when i sit ... not attractive . wish i could return them but i took the tag off and wore them not knowing this before hand ! ! if in between sizes definitely size down ."

__label__0 "bought a pair of the gray and loved them but after i washed them i saw the color was distorted as if bleach from a previous wash was still in the machine . so i ordered a second pair this one in green - same thing happened after i washed it . looked at instructions ( finally ! ) and it says to wash in cold water - i washed in warm . could that be the problem ? anyway - now they both look like there 's discoloration and not a washed look that 's on purpose . i 'll still wear them but an expe"
__label__-1 "i rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever . but this dress is awful . i ordered the black and white . the fabric is very poor quality . the colors are washed out . i almost did n't try it on but i did and found that for me the fit was terrible ( though some of the reviewer pictures are cute ) ."
__label__-1 "the top of this suit was not proportioned well . i am normally a 34c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium . the cup size on this was very small for a medium . the band to hook in the back was almost too big . there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup . the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back ."
__label__0 "the blue was a great color and i like the idea of a reversible top . however the xs was just swimming on me . this looks much more fitted in the pictures . my favorite workout top is from this brand and it is fitted and held up for 6 months . where are the fitted tops ? ? i 'll keep looking ."
__label__1 "love these pants they do run small in the hip area and are not stretchy at all . so beware if you are curvy you might want to size up . great quality and style overall ."
__label__-1 "really wanted to love this top but the proportion was not right for my body type . also the print with the silhouette was a bit too country bumpkin for me ."
__label__1 "i sat on this top for about 2 weeks waiting for more reviews to see if it was worth buying . i finally took a chance on it and i 'm glad that i did . this top is really cute . i love the asymetrical pattern . it 's long enough that it goes great with my black skinny jeans . the v neckline is perfect ... not too low . i got this in my usual size large and it fits perfectly . i wish that the sleeves were slightly longer but that should n't be a problem for someone not as tall . it 's a quirky and ador"
__label__-1 "the top looks better on the model than in-person . it fits loose and looks boxy and matronly . i do n't like the sleeve length or the top style it just did n't look flattering or good . i am sending it back . looks very boxy ."
__label__-1 "the fabric is very nice on this wrap but it wears like a blanket ."
__label__0 "the dress is not like pictured . it is above the knee and sleeves are neither 3/4 nor full length-somewhere in between . i am 5 ' 4 112 lbs bought xs regular . had higher expectations for the price . going back to the store ."
__label__1 "i love this t-shirt i wish it came in tons of other prints ! very soft almost feels lived in and high quality all the same ."
__label__-1 "cute and very soft but the elastic was n't sewn in right . i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess . disappointing for more expensive loungewear ."
__label__0 "this is a cute dress but the buttons are tiny and the top one cracked in half before i could even put the dress on . i ca n't risk the buttons breaking off while i am wearing it . especially since the dress seems designed for an a cup anything larger will be more than those little fragile buttons can handle ."
__label__1 "if the dress fits there is nothing not to love about it . the color of mine is exactly like the catalogue and first photo online ( deeper and richer than the studio photos ) . it is not too sheer as another reviewer reported . it has a slip and the fabric is beautiful . the issue i 've had has been sizing and style . i wear a size 2. i ordered an xs . the dress i received was not the style of the catalogue dress or the first dress in the online photos . i was looking for the very floaty full dres"
__label__-1 "i put on this t-shirt and my husband said it makes you look old . he was right . i 'm not sure if it 's the cut or the pattern but i found it completely unflattering on my petite frame and it looked cheap too . perhaps on someone else it would look different . the pattern is overwhelming and the sleeps are a bit too look and ruched for my liking . it may look better on someone taller ."
__label__-1 "this is a cute top but it runs pretty big . order a size down . the material is like a thick gauze almost so i 'd definitely wear a tank under ."
__label__-1 "this looked so odd on me ! i decided to give it to someone with a different body type and she found it really odd too . the sleeve are a bit too long to be short and they are tight at the bottom . the top is really large as to be unflattering . perhaps it 's just that it does n't work on someone who is petite but this one is a return ."
__label__-1 "i love retailer and fell in love as soon as i saw this dress online . being 5'10 i love a quality maxi dress and this one did not disappoint . however being 5'10 also means the top sweater overlay hits me way short . it looks ridiculous . i also thought that this was very heavy for a maxi dress and could not imagine wearing it in 80 degree weather . unfortunately after waiting so long for it 's arrival this is going back ."
__label__0 "i bought the orange in xxs petite and the cream in the xsp as it did not come in xxs . i like a swing style but this is a tent . the material in the cream is fairly sheer and i found hanging threads that came from suspect seams . the overall effects was being lost in all the fabric . they rather skew old school maternity in summation . mine are going back ."
__label__1 "love this color ! when i saw this beautiful blue color in the store i had to try them on ! so pretty ! if you love pilcro chinos -- you will be happy with these ! same great fit and an awesome color !"
__label__1 "as always these pilcro pants did not disappoint . i can always order a size 26 and know they will fit like a custom pant . i actually like the fit on me better than shown on the model . there is no crotch hang like in the photo . i need to wear heels with these because of the length but heels and flares are very slimming ."
__label__0 "i just loved this when i saw it in store . beautiful fabric lovely color . i ordered a small petite because petite xs was sold out . i imagine it might be a little better if it were a size smaller but there is sooo much fabric in the pleated bottom unless you are blessed with exceptionally long legs it might end up looking like a witches coat . at least that is what i was told by my daughter ."
__label__1 "got the wine color and love it ! the design definitely is slimming ! 5 ' 1 120lb got size 4 ."
__label__-1 "top is completely see through . i cant imagine if it were to get wet what it would look like . it is a cute design but not practical at all ."
__label__1 "i bought this with the intention of taking it on a very warm trip - and i think it 'll do just fine ! it 's a wonderful open-gauge knit - delicate and light but substantial enough that i do n't fear snagging it constantly . the cloth has a nice weight and drape and while the fit is on the loose side it does look intentional . wonderful as a pullover or by itself . i have the minty blue-green color and it 's divine . definitely worth the price ."
__label__1 "i bought this to give room for an expanding tummy - i 'm 6 months pregnant and this completely conceals the bulge . i suspect i will appreciate that in the spring when i 'm actually trying to hide my leftover belly ... it 's incredibly soft and the top is wide enough to cover a bra strap . the arm holes are small enough to cover my parts but large enough to be comfy . i 'm 5 ' 5 medium build and normally wear a medium but got a large given my circumstances . a medium would have probably worked normal"
__label__0 "i usually wear a small 4 or 6 and in this dress i could n't even zip up the 8. so tight in the rib cage and chest . if i tried to go up even further the bottom half got much bigger . guess this one is not for me ."
__label__-1 "i was sooo excited to buy this top and it was such a bummer . this top hangs so poorly and is so droopy under the arms . it 's clearly poorly made and the sizing was way off on me . i ordered my usual medium and it was so large and wide that i had to return it . it weirdly fit perfectly in the shoulders and arm length as mediums do for me but was so wide and unflattering for my figure ( 5 ' 8 and athletic ) . i really wanted to like this top and considered ordering a small to see if it would fit better bu"
__label__0 "i really like the pilcro serif style but the stet style does not work for my body . will have to return ."
__label__1 "this dress is so cute ! will you be bringing it back retailer ?"
__label__-1 "bummer i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen . seriously looks maternity to me . the neck is also too wide . the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just did n't work on me . i returned this one ."
__label__1 "i really liked the beautiful fabric design and length of the piece ."
__label__0 "just a warning . i am always a 6 or 8 and even the 8 was so tight in the waist i could barely out this on . if you do n't have a super tiny upper waist this wo n't fit well . too bad because it 's super cute if a bit sheer ."
__label__0 "i purchased the green dress in medium . i usually wear a medium . the fabric is pretty . shoulders fit nicely . sleeves were short in an odd length but that is indeed pictured accurately . the body of the dress is very shapeless billowy and wide which made this appear far more like a nightgown than the photo shown . i considered altering the garment by sewing in the sides from the armpit downward but i decided to return the dress ."
__label__0 "frumpy is the word i would use to describe this top . i look good in empire waist shirts and seek them out . but this one made me look pregnant and frumpy . and it has an attached camisole but the sheerness of the top still showed my nude-colored bra strap . so i do n't even know what to wear under it . it 's going back even with the sale price ."
__label__1 "loved pattern quality and fine details on this dress but it ran large . i ordered petite small and it was way too loose/baggy .i had to return it . i went bsck to order a petite x/small but it was no longer available in this size on- line . so disappointed ! fyi i 'm 5 ' 112-115lbs and small boned -always wear size petite small . but not fir this dress ! this dress is comfortable well made lined and pattern is extremely pretty with nice border ( which is hard to find for petites -a"
__label__0 "if you have muscular thighs like me these wo n't fit well . i 'm usually a size 8-fitted/10-relaxed i bought these in a large and the shins were the most relaxed part . had to return for not fitting well . but the quality of the product was nice ."
__label__0 "this dress is very pretty colorwise but the fit did not work for me . i could see this working on girls with narrow hips but it did n't flatter my narrow waist/wide hip frame ."
__label__1 "this top is just darling ! the body of the top is lightweight sweatshirt type material that 's dyed to appear well used . the ruffling along the bottom is color coordinated and beautifully textured . great to wear with leggings ! the back hangs lower than the front so your rear will be covered . extremely comfortable machine washable . an unexpectedly nicer than it looks online garment . i bought the blue version which looks more lavender irl ."
__label__1 "i had been eying this dress online for a while and when it finally came into stores i was so excited ! this dress is so gorgeous and very flattering on my body . i love the bottom of it it is more of a u cut in the front and square in the back . add an ada wrap belt and perfection !"
__label__0 "i absolutely fell in love with the stress when i sought in the store . the fabric and drape of the fabric is amazing ! however it runs extremely small . i normally wear a medium and can sometimes even wear a small and dresses . i tried on the medium and the large and i could not even get them zipped all the way . i 'm so disappointed as this is a gorgeous dress . definitely size up at least one maybe two sizes ."
__label__1 "i 'm petite and pear shaped so i 'm small on top and curvy around the hips and love the way this dress fits . it 's a relaxed fit so it 's not super fitted and it 's loose around the waist which is great . it 's a wonderful casual dress to wear with a pair of tall boots . i adore it !"
__label__0 "beautiful - ordered a s i wear a 2 in most retailer items . hand washed in cold water shrunk inches yes inches ! love maeve clothing this shirt is gorgeous . before hand washing in the sink it was large and flowy . now it barely fits ."
__label__0 "i like the look of this tee and the fit is fine but it 's described as a cotton-rayon jersey and in fact it 's 50 % polyester . i would not have ordered if i had known and now have to take it back ."
__label__-1 "the material is very nice . not flimsy at all which is nice . the problem was the fit around the arms . i am a petite person with a small chest but it still did n't cover me bra . i 'll be returning it ."
__label__1 "this top is my new favorite . i ordered it on a whim and oh boy am i glad ! ! i was so excited for it to be shipped to me and once it arrived i could n't wait to put it . once i put it on i could n't wait to show it off ! it is such a great bluish-grayish color and looks great with some big hoop earrings shorts and sandals . such an easy classic simple shirt that i will probably wear too much ."
__label__0 "as you can see there is an array of differing opinions on here and i share sentiments on both : _______ pros : - the texture and feel of this is great ; it is very comfortable and is different . - tts for the most part ; i normally can wear sizes 10 and 12 ( m and l ) with most retailer and got the medium and the fit was overall fine but more snug at the hips . if you 're more slim/straight it 'll probably fit you like on the model . - good length not too short or too long . - the mock collar is ni"
__label__-1 "the chevron pattern on the mint/seaside version needs to be centered in the front to look right . mine was totally off so i returned it and had them overnight me a new one to my vacation address . unfortunately the 2nd suit i received was also off center . that one is going back too . would have loved this otherwise ! a quality check on this is definitely needed .... beware ."
__label__-1 "i purchased the blue with white dots . the shape was awful but looked like a sack - returned"
__label__0 "this is a very comfortable shirt great basic to have in the wardrobe it runs a little high on the sides"
__label__1 "loving this jumpsuit ! i normally a medium top small bottom i bought the medium it fits right . soft fabric and nice color ."
__label__1 "love this blouse . i usually wear a small and had to exchange it for an xs which fits perfectly . not form fitting but flattering ; washes beautifully too . i highly recommend this blouse ."
__label__-1 "i loved this dress from the moment i tried it on . so flattering to my postpartum body without being a huge tent . soft fabric and for a white/lightly striped dress not sheer . i 'm bummed because after washing only twice ( followed the instructions to wash ) on gentle cycle and low tumble dry holes started appearing everywhere both on the cream ribbed hem in the front bottom and all across the chest in the white part of the fabric only ( it looks like the black stripes are holding the holes toget"
__label__0 "comfortable and soft material cute design and nice longer length .. however i 'm long waisted and this looked ridiculous on my me elastic came up right under my bra and not at my waist . would be cute for someone shorter ."
__label__-1 "i adore the feel and cut of these culottes but the quality has diminished my faith in retailer . picks piles and serious wear and tear after just one day . i feel as if i wasted my money ."
__label__0 "this skirt looks exactly as pictured and fits great . i purchased it a few weeks ago and got lots of compliments on it . however on the third wear the side zipper split wide open . needless to say it was returned ."
__label__1 "these are beautiful and very comfy . they do run very large . i ordered the green in medium and deciding wether to exchange for a small . the washing instructions in the pants are to dry clean for best results . the description needs to be updated to reflect this ."
__label__0 "was excited about this sweater but it really did n't wow me when i put it on . the v-neck is quite low and the sweater is a bit short . loved the ideas of the fringe but in the end it went back ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this skirt in a size small and when i received it not only was it too long but there was also a hole in it . so i returned it . when a small petite became available i ordered it thinking it would fit better . i just received it and there is a hole in this skirt as well . both skirts also looked as if they had been worn ; there was fuzz and lint all over the skirts . i like the skirt but i either have extremely bad luck or it 's really bad quality ."
__label__0 "i ordered this dress when it was briefly on sale with an extra percent off . i was very excited to receive it in my usual size large and wear with a jean jacket and cowboy boots . when i took it out of the package i could tell it looked really small . i did n't even try it on . i had my daughter who wears a size small try it on and she could n't even get it over her hips . if you are tall and thin like the model it will work for you . it is made of cupro looks exactly like the photo the color is g"
__label__-1 "this may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried . the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo absolutely garish . the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties it just looks cheap . the skirt is an antebellum nightmare . i did not even want to try it on it 's that bad . i considered adding a photo but was too horrified . for reference i 'm 5'10 approximately the height/ size of the model but it was shorter than the photo depictes . i wanted to like it"
__label__0 "there were no reviews when i ordered this tunic so nothing to help gauge fit . it is very cute but the fit is strange - very narrow in the shoulders and chest ."
__label__-1 "this is very large . i normally am a s/m and i took this in an x. it is a beautiful dress in color and fit but picks up any stain and i have had to have it dry cleaned after every use ."
__label__-1 "this looked beautiful online but the skirt is n't 100 % silk - the strips of fabric have different fiber content levels with most of them containing some level of polyester . parts of the skirt felt like plastic to touch and one strip has a very prominent gold sheen that looks cheap . overall very disappointing - this is not at all the beautiful silk skirt that it appears to be online . a definite return . i would n't even recommend this at first or second cut ."
__label__0 "pretty tee but not worth the price . lace is beautiful but fit is blah ."
__label__1 "i got this for my girlfriend and was happy they had additional sizes online as we were not able to find this in the store . we loved that this could be worn stand alone with leggings or as an over-shirt . it 's very versatile and is perfect for your fall wardrobe ."
__label__0 "i ordered the large since the med was n't available and it did n't complement my figure because it was too loose all over . i like the design detail with off-center buttons and the fabric is a nice quality ."
__label__1 "many internet reviews note that byron lars dresses run large and suggest that women 5 ' 5 and under should size down and go petite . i am 5 ' 3 and 101 pounds and the 0 petite size was too snug across my back and too short when i sat down . when i stood up i had to pull the dress down as it would bunch up around the hips . therefore the size 2 regular ended up being a perfect fit no alterations needed . i was searching for a dress for an upcoming wedding and for vacation and kept coming back to thi"

__label__-1 "i do n't know how to explain but this dress at least for me did not look like the model first off the dress is extremely heavy and extremely long and then where the fur starts for me it did n't start at the right spot so it was very awkward looking ... so definitely not for my type of body i am normal height ( 5 ' 5 '' athletic and curvy body ) but maybe for a very tall person looks good ! the material is very interesting it 's so soft !"
__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress . i ordered an xsmall and a small . i am 5 ' 6 and 110 lbs slender build . the xsmall fit great everywhere but the waist band was completely out of portion for the dress . both sizes will have to be returned . possibly if you have a more straight up and down figure it will fit better and pull in your waist !"
__label__0 "i bought these for a trip to the caribbean . i sweat a lot . if you have ever been humiliated by having a ring of sweat around your crotch area then i do not recommend these shorts in the moss color . this color and fabric do not camouflage sweat . i will spare you the photos ."

__label__1 "i am usually a 00 or 0 in dresses and i ended up with a 4 in this one . i could barley zip up the 0 and while i could have gotten away with the 2 there is no elasticity in the waistband . the 4 is very slightly roomy but more comfortable than the smaller sizes on me . for reference i 'm 109-111 lbs 5 ' 4 and a 30b . when i was finally able to wear the dress i got compliments galore . it really is a beautiful dress ! just be sure to size up !"
__label__0 "very cute shirt well made nice detail but a little long for my taste but i did keep it"

__label__0 "i so wanted to like these pants . i wear a lot of genie pants because they 're comfortable . the problem with these is that they 're too narrow towards the ankle but the worst is the fabric . its old lady fabric . i was hoping for a pair of blousy joggers in a light denim and this fabric was disgraceful . i knew the minute i saw them that they were going back . i 'll keep looking and hoping ."
__label__1 "i love these pants . i vary between 10 & 12 the 10 fit perfectly since they are designed on the fuller size perfect for my body type of small waist and a bit of bottom . so many colors to coordinate with these pants . teal green retailer yellow black ... i am not fond of ankle pants prefer longer pants . i took the cuffs down and lengthened the pants . the only problem is that these pants are so exquisitely made removing the cuff tacks was a challenge ! perfect pants for those of us who have shape"
__label__-1 "it is so cute in the picture but was n't flattering on me . it also felt like i could n't raise my arms while wearing it . i love retailer and will be a forever fan but this dress just was n't for me ."
__label__-1 "i wish i had read the reviews prior to purchasing . this skirt looks amazing in photos and lace appears black . the lace on mine is actually purple - at first i thought it was just purple due to lighting with red underneath - but nope - pull the netting away and it is purple . lace netting hikes up on the right due to poor craftsmanship . i ordered a medium and felt it was a bit large . will return ."
__label__0 "great item . ordered for my wife for christmas . received it and the medium petite waist size measured at approximately 26 ( so it is at least 2 off the standard -- and a thick material needs a bit more room to fit well ) . disappointed ! replaced with next size up ... we 'll see !"
__label__1 "i saw the orange/tangerine colored version of this sweater and loved it . it looked beautiful on top . the chiffon material at the bottom of the sweater is a lovely detail . sadly the bottom portion of the sweater made my hips look huge and i felt i looked pregnant . i weigh 111lbs . i am petite and small boned . i think it was because i am short waisted that this style did not suit me . i wish i could look good in this ! it is absolutely exquisite in color and texture ."
__label__-1 "i wanted a comfortable and loose casual dress . i liked the pictures and decided to give it a try . the dress turned out to be too loose ( i got size 4 after checking the measurements chart i 'm 5 ' 7 ' 125 lb and usually wear s ) . i could practically wrap myself in this dress . besides it looks a bit too long ( well i 'm not as tall as the model in the photos and i do n't like wearing high heels ) . the material looks faded not as bright as in the pictures . i like distressed and vintage style but this"

__label__-1 "i keep trying to find a peplum that works for me but so far i have been unsuccessful . i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well together ? aside from the peplum issue this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large . the material alone is thick making it a bulkier shirt then add the volume of the peplum and i looked ( and felt ) huge . needless to say this one was returned sale or no sale ."
__label__-1 "usually i really like deletta and know the sizing and shapes . this top looked pretty in the pics and i thought it would be a nice change from a tee . it was baggy hung low and the layers just looked boxy and shapeless ."
__label__-1 "i was really disappointed in the shirt . the blue embroidery is a lot darker than what is shown in the photo and barely stands out against the black . the photo does not accurately depict this shirt . i will be returning ."

__label__-1 "i wanted to love this . could n't wait for it to arrive . unfortunately it does n't look anything like the picture . i usually wear a m/l in holding horses so i ordered a l but as soon as i held it up i noticed it was ridiculously large . the fabric is on the heavy side so the dress just hangs in a very unflattering way . and it is extremely shimmery . i love velvet but the texture and sheen of this dress was just over the top . sadly it is going back ."
__label__-1 "this top is perfect for the first day at clown college if you want to see some clowns cry . the sleeves are probably the worst part of this overpriced monstrosity . the elastic at the cuffs makes the already comically large sleeves billow and puff out even more . buy this if you enjoy walking to the post office to return things ."
__label__0 "the blouse was not flattering on me . it would be for someone with a straight slim body type it falls mid hips and so it accentuates my hips making them look larger . it 's flared so it can not really be tucked in ."
__label__-1 "this dress looks and feels cheap . the white material is stiff and does not iron nicely . the grey sweater is super thin and very cheap looking . overall a pretty horrible dress . save your money"
__label__1 "very cute top and so comfortable ! it runs big i 'm between a medium and large . i ordered the large and it 's definitely a little big but wearable . i probably should 've swapped it for a medium but it 's still really cute !"
__label__-1 "it runs large . loose or oversized tops do n't bother me so i thought it would be fine but this just made me look wider then i am . is thin and too sheer for me as well . it was just so unflattering . i had to return it ."
__label__1 "this skirt is perfect ! it just pulls on and lays nice and smooth . the fabric is soft and just the right thickness and stretch . i wore it with black tights and knee high boots for new year 's eve and had many compliments ! it runs a tad big . i am about 130lb and the small fits great although a tad larger than i would have expected . i assume it might srink in the wash a little anyway . my new favorite !"
__label__1 "prior reviewer nailed it with the summary of this dress . it definitely needs heels . i 'm 5 ' 4 120 # 34d and this is a size 36. i usually wear a size s or 4 with most retailer stuff ."
__label__-1 "i have other stevies and these are nothing like them . the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny . the pants themselves run very small in the waist approx . two sizes too small compared with other stevies . additionally the cuff is sewn like that in place and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves . see how it gapes in the cuff on the model ? like a rounded bottom ? that is way more emphasized in real life . buyer beware !"
__label__0 "the fabric of this skirt is absolutely beautiful . however the fit albeit unique is not extremely flattering in my opinion . it may be because i am somewhat of a pear/hourglass shape rather than a more straight shape but the fit is a little off imo . i am 5 ' 8 and 135 # and ordered both the 6 & 8 and felt the 8 fit a little better ."
__label__1 "i do love this shirt but when it arrived it had makeup around the collar apparently from someone else who had tried it on . i was able to clean it up with just soap and water so no big problem but it did make for a poor first impression !"
__label__1 "the photo does n't do it justice . the detail on the neckline is adorable and looks fantastic with jeans . texture is light and gauze-y but i do n't find it too see-though . sizing was tough- i 'm 5'10 but thin on top- usually between xs & s and went with the xs on this ( ordered both to try ) sacrificing some length for a more flattering width . great for the sale price ! ! !"
__label__-1 "this shirt looked cute until i tried it on ... worst fit ever . im thin and this style of top is usually quite flattering but this one missed the mark big time ."
__label__0 "the sweater fits a bit awkward in the front . it draped more than i would have liked . also the transition from the stripes to the solid gray felt non cohesive because of the stitching . returned the item ."

__label__0 "the skirt part of the dress falls straight and accentuated my stomach . you ca n't really tell from the pic . but if you have even the slightest bump of a stomach the dress might make it look worse instead of better because of the way that it is cut . i 'm pretty slim - 5 ' 5 '' and 114 pounds and it was n't doing me any favors ! the top of the dress is beautiful ! i will exchange it for something else . i ordered it online and could n't try it on before purchasing it ."
__label__1 "love this kimono . design is bohemian and it will be a great layering piece . can be belted over simple black dress or layered with jeans and boots . almost did n't purchase because of the reviews concerned with fragile material but i did n't find that to be an issue once i felt the garment . great piece for fall ."
__label__1 "i love these shorts . they 're really comfortable and versatile . i got them on sale and for the price they were a steal ! the material is nice and you can dress them up or down ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this blouse so much . but try as i might it just fit so oddly on me . i 'm usually a petite s so i purchased the xs in brown . first . the color was more gray-brown but it was still ok. but second the fit was off . maybe i just got a bad one but the center of the blouse was so offset that the slit in the front laid so far to the left and the v-neck was so low that you could see my bra - there was no adjusting i could do to fix it . the material has a lovely soft silky feel to it an"
__label__1 "i have been wanting this skirt since it came out and was overjoyed when it went on sale . i got my typical 00 size ( 24-26 waist xsmall-xxsmall shirts/dresses ) but when i tried it on i was a bit confused . the waist is a little roomy so there 's no way i could wear a 0 but the skirt hugs my butt . and i 'm talking in that weird hug the butt but flares out awkwardly below way . now i do n't consider myself particularly gifted in the back end department but this skirt sure says the opposite ! i can '"
__label__1 "this is a cute sweater i agree that it 's slightly boxy partly because of the side pockets which i think are cute . the yellow is darker than it appears on my screen more like a mustardy-gold which is not great on my skin tone . i think it 's true to size i got my usual retailer size : xspetite ( i 'm 34aa 26 waist ) and it fits just right . it 's soft and a nice medium weight . on the packaging it was called a bomber so i 'd say it is cut a little like a bomber jacket ."
__label__0 "i bought this for an upcoming conference and was grateful that it shipped very promptly . it runs quite large in my opinion . i 'm 5 ' 7 and about 130-135lbs . the small was huge on me in the chest and shoulders/arms . the stomach also was n't very fitted . the material is thinner than i expected ( you can see through the dress to some extent when you hold it up to the light ) but i do n't think this is a problem necessarily . had it been thicker it probably would be too warm . but you might need a slip"
__label__1 "this is a pretty dress . like the positive reviews have noted . very figure flattering"
__label__1 "these tight cords are perfect for fall ."
__label__1 "i was n't sure what to expect when i ordered this but when it arrived i was pleasantly surprised that it 's by postmark and has an interesting cut . i ordered the xl in the hope that it would be oversized and slouchy . it is that and more ! the lightweight sweater like material is truly perfect for the transition to spring . i look forward to wearing it tomorrow !"
